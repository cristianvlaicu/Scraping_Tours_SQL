# What is this app?

With this app we can extract information from a web page, store it in a SQL file or .txt file and then send us via email that file as notification.

Note: If you want to use or to try this proyect, please open the emailing script and modify the data from password, sender and reciever. Those data you can see there are my "personal data" and it 
would not work cause I have located my personal password in a system file location. To can use your data from gmail, you can go to your gmail account manager, activate dual verification and when it's 
done, you can set a unique password for this aplication, emailing.

Main script is formatted with BLACK.
